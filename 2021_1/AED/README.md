# Algorithms and Data Structures (AED)

Repository created to store all code projects and works created during graduation. Unfortunately some projects were lost.

## Subject Description

Algorithms and Data Structure is one of the most important subjects of the course, through it we know some fundamental algorithms of data structures. The language chosen was C++.

## Contents
The course was divided into 5 topics:

### Stack
The stack works in such a way that the last element to be inserted will be the first to be withdrawn: ***Last-In/First-Out (LIFO)*** . Thus, a stack allows access to only one data item - the last inserted, called *top*. For this, we use the primitive functions: `push` and `pop`.

For the implementation, two approaches were used: 

* **Static Stack**: the data is in a vector. 
  
    [Class](/2021_1/AED/Stack/StaticStack.h) | [Main](/2021_1/AED/Stack/StaticMain.cpp)

* **Dynamic Stack**: the data is stored in a node.

    [Class](/2021_1/AED/Stack/DynamicStack.h) | [Main](/2021_1/AED/Stack/DynamicMain.cpp)

### Queue
The Queue works in such a way that the first element to be inserted will be the
first to be withdrawn: ***First In First Out (FIFO)***. The primitive functions are: `append` and `serve`.

For the implementation, two approaches were used: 

* **Static Queue**: the data is in a vector. 
  
    [Class](/2021_1/AED/Queue/StaticQueue.h) | [Main](/2021_1/AED/Queue/StaticMain.cpp)

* **Dynamic Queue**: the data is stored in a node.

    [Class](/2021_1/AED/Queue/DynamicQueue.h) | [Main]()

### List


### Sort
There are several types of sorting algorithms, including: *Insertion Sort*, *Bubble Sort*, *Quick Sort* and *Selection Sort*. Only the last one was implemented.

* [Selection Sort](/2021_1/AED/Sort/SelectionSort.cpp)
